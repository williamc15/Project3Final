# The main module that executes your Grin interpreter.
#
# WHAT YOU NEED TO DO: You'll need to implement the outermost shell of your
# program here, but consider how you can keep this part as simple as possible,
# offloading as much of the complexity as you can into additional modules in
# the 'grin' package, isolated in a way that allows you to unit test them.
